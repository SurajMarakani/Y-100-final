            <h1>Insight</h1>
                <p>Throughout these 8 weeks I have learned alot about the SICE program and how to secure a job after college. Alot of the insight from this course came mainly from the morning powerpoint lectures. For example how to make a resume and the TED TALK video, the resume presentation contained alot of information that I didn't know  I needed and the TED TALK was very interesting to listen and learn about how people change in the span of 10 years</p>
                <br />
                <p>Considering I took a BootCamp for JavaScript over the summer which had taught information through a work style environment. I didn't get too much insight over the Design Challenge, however I learned more on what a consultant does. And that process of designing and consulting then engineering can be useful for someone who had not gone through that process before.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The most insightful assignment was the Tech Career Profile. The assignment required research on jobs and the type of skills required for the job. I was also very interested in what that assignemnt had to offer.</p>

    <!-- Design -->

    <section id="design">
    <div class="infoBox">
            <h1>Design</h1>
            <p>My current plans academically is to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in software engineering or AI. I do have a plan to get an MBA after my bachelors however that may not be a realistic plan becuase of the time and money required for it.</p>
            <br />
            <p>My future career plan are to get a job. Preferably start with a startup but also apply to facebook and microsoft. I plan on being a fullstack developer and if not most likely front end developer. Over the summer I also plan to get some internships. This summer I have one at my dad's company INDOT but I am hoping to get a job at UITS.</p>
            <br />
            <p>The insight I have gained from this course applies to my career plans especially from the resume information and linkedin profiles. Also the tech career profile helped me gain information on the types of jobs available for my degree, finally the SICE career fair helped me alot with those career plans and had myself get introduced to alot of companies.</p>

            <p>I thought you were a great teacher. I had learned alot and the class was very interactive. Although my group was not that great. I had fun because of the fantastic engagement you had with the class and the modules on canvas. I want to ask more questions in the future as well mainly regarding my career plans.</p>
